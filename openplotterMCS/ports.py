# Here you have to define all the TCP/UDP connections on localhost managed by your app so that the main app can wtch for conflicts. Use this format:

# {'id':'uniqueId', description':_('My App'), 'data':_('Signal K keys:')+'Random.Number1, Random.Number2', 'direction':'1/2/3', 'type':'UDP/TCP', 'mode':'client/server', 'address':'localhost', 'port':000000, 'editable':'1'}
#
# id (text, required): any unique id 
# description (text, required): use translatable text
# data (text, optional): details about the data like signal k key, NMEA sentences or PGN...
# direction (text, optional): 1= in, 2=out, 3=both
# type (text, required): TCP or UDP
# mode (text, required): client or server. Normally you can only set one TCP/UDP server for the same port. You can define multiple TCP/UDP clients for the same port. 
# Clients and servers can send and receive data. A UDP connection listenning on any port will be a server. A UDP connection just sending data to any port will be a client. 
# A TCP connection listenning on any port can be client or server
# address (text, required): this should always be localhost
# port (number, required): the port where the connections is set
# editable (text, optional): if your app provide a way of changing the port, set this value to '1'
